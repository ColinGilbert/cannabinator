Welcome! As the name suggests, the Cannabinator growing system is a project for growing large amounts of high-quality cannabis. However, it is also an excellent all-purpose playground for botany.

The Cannabinator growing system is currently in the early-to-mid prototyping stage and is currently undergoing intensive shakedown testing in order to ascertain its long-term safety. This repository has been created as a holding pool for all relevant information relevant, including but not limited to: computer code, build and operation instructions, CAD files, bills of material, component datasheets, third-party research, and safety warnings.

It is expected to be very active for the next following months, as part of the reason we are setting this up is in preparation for the prototype's refinement into a finished product as part of our CS476 project at University of Regina, which is coming up in early September. It is intended both for our team to work in and to showcase the fruits of our labour. Be sure to bookmark this page, as this bird has started to fly!
